# Online_Retail_Exploratory_Data_Analysis

## Guidelines

- In the data folder there are two files, one of them is **Raw Data** and another is a cleaned & filtered data and has been names as **sales_df**
- In case you just need to go through project, there is a **PDF** file in the form of PPT report, which succintly takes you through the project.
- For a **detailed technical understanding** of the project, you can refer to the **Jupyter Notebook** file.

## Introduction

In this project, we analyze transactional data from an online retail store to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. The dataset details customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps.

This Exploratory data analysis, aims to identify patterns, outliers, and correlations to enable data-driven decision making for stakeholders. We will uncover key trends like the top performing business regions, busiest sales months, best-selling products, and order frequency, using visualizations and statistical analysis.

Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.

## Dataset

The dataset we will be working with is the "Online Retail" dataset. It contains transactional data of an online retail store from 2010 to 2011.

The dataset contains the following columns:<br>
**InvoiceNo:** Invoice number of the transaction, if the code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.<br>
**StockCode:** Unique code of the product.<br>
**Description:** Description of the product.<br>
**Quantity:** Quantity of the product in the transaction.<br>
**InvoiceDate:** Date and time of the transaction.<br>
**UnitPrice:** Unit price of the product.<br>
**CustomerID:** Unique identifier of the customer.<br>
**Country:** Country where the transaction occurred.<br>

## Analysis Approach


- As this is a large dataset, the primary objective here in this project is to understand the data.
- Distribution of the data has been explored and evaluated before & after the data cleaning. 
- Apart from regular data cleaning, many non  sale entries had to be removed.
- Further, basic statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to have a better understanding of data was performed.
- Then, specific questions were explored to have more insights.
- Data Visualization has been utilized to derive inferences.
- The Analysis is based on:
    - Python version – 3.11.7
    - Numpy version – 1.26.2
    - Pandas version – 2.1.4
    - Matplotlib version – 3.8.0
