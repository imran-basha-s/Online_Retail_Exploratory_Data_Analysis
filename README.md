# Online_Retail_Exploratory_Data_Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, we analyze transactional data from an online retail store to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. The dataset details customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps.
This Exploratory data analysis, aims to identify patterns, outliers, and correlations to enable data-driven decision making for stakeholders. We will uncover key trends like the top performing business regions, busiest sales months, best-selling products, and order frequency, using visualizations and statistical analysis.
Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.
